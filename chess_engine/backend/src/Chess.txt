Explanation of the code in the files -

Piece.h:
Defines PieceType and PieceColor enums to represent the type and color of a chess piece.
Defines the Piece class with private member variables for PieceType and PieceColor.
Provides public methods to get and set the type and color of the piece, and a method to convert the piece to a string representation.

Piece.cpp:
Implements the constructor and methods defined in Piece.h.
The toString method returns a human-readable representation of the piece.

Move.h:
Defines the Move class with private member variables for the start and end coordinates of the move (fromRow, fromCol, toRow, toCol) and the piece being moved.
Provides public methods to get and set these values and a method to convert the move to a string representation.

Move.cpp:
Implements the constructor and methods defined in Move.h.
The toString method returns a human-readable representation of the move, including the start and end coordinates and the piece involved.

ChessBoard.h:
Declares the ChessBoard class and its methods.
Includes methods to set up the board (setupBoard), generate moves (generateMoves), execute moves (executeMove), and convert the board to a string (boardToString).
Defines private helper methods for generating moves for different pieces and a method to check board boundaries.

ChessBoard.cpp:
Implements the ChessBoard class methods.
Initializes the board with starting positions for pieces in the setupBoard method.
Includes placeholders for move generation methods (generateKnightMoves, generateBishopMoves, etc.), which you need to implement.
The executeMove method updates the board based on a move and ensures moves are within bounds.

GameEngine.h:
Declares the GameEngine class with methods to start a new game (startGame), make a move (makeMove), get the board state (getBoardState), and check if the game is over (isGameOver).
Includes private methods for validating moves (isValidMove), switching players (switchPlayer), and detecting checkmate and stalemate (checkCheckmate and checkStalemate).

GameEngine.cpp:
Implements the methods declared in GameEngine.h.
The startGame method initializes the board and sets the starting player.
The makeMove method validates and executes a move, switching the player if the move is valid.
The getBoardState method retrieves the current board state as a string.
The isValidMove method is a placeholder where move validation logic should be added.
The switchPlayer method toggles between the white and black players.
The checkCheckmate and checkStalemate methods are placeholders for implementing checkmate and stalemate detection.

AIPlayer.h:
Declares the AIPlayer class with methods to get the best move (getBestMove), evaluate the board (evaluateBoard), generate possible moves (generatePossibleMoves), and select a random move (selectRandomMove).
Contains a private member color to store the AI player's color.

AIPlayer.cpp:
Implements the methods declared in AIPlayer.h.
The getBestMove method generates possible moves and selects a random move as a placeholder strategy.
The evaluateBoard method is a placeholder for board evaluation logic.
The generatePossibleMoves method loops through all pieces of the AIâ€™s color and generates moves for each piece.
The selectRandomMove method randomly selects a move from the list of possible moves using the <random> library.

Note -
Evaluation Function: In a real AI, the evaluateBoard function would analyze the board position and assign a score to determine the best move based on various factors (e.g., material balance, piece activity).
Move Selection: The random move selection is a placeholder. Advanced AI would use algorithms like Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning to select the best move.

Utilities.h:
positionToNotation: Converts board coordinates (row, col) to standard chess notation (e.g., e4).
notationToPosition: Converts chess notation (e.g., e4) to board coordinates (row, col).
printMoves: Prints out a list of moves in a human-readable format.
isValidPosition: Validates that the given position is within the bounds of the chessboard.

Utilities.cpp:
positionToNotation: Converts numeric coordinates to chess notation, using ASCII values for file and rank.
notationToPosition: Converts chess notation to numeric coordinates, with basic validation for position length and range.
printMoves: Iterates through a vector of Move objects and prints each move. The Move class should have a toString() method for this to work.
isValidPosition: Checks if the given row and column are within the bounds of the chessboard (0 to 7).
